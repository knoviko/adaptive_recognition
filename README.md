Adaptive recognition for objects of heterogeneous classes using nested deep learning methods   

Graduation thesis on the topic "Adaptive recognition for objects of
heterogeneous classes using nested deep learning methods" consists of seven main
sections, a conclusion, two appendices and a list of references.
In the first section "Introduction" current information concerning the research
topic is considered, a brief description of the features of the future development is
given.  
In the second section "Statement of the problem" the goals and objectives of the
WRC are formulated, as well as the requirements for the developed models and
software.  
In the third section "Development of an approach for solving the problem" the
structure of the identification model of heterogeneous objects was designed based on
the nested application of two types of models - a clustering model that determines the
type of object, and several classification models that determine the type of object
within the type. An assumption is made about the effectiveness of the model.  
In the fourth section "Review of existing methods suitable for solving the
problem", a review and analysis of the theoretical foundations in the subject area, as
well as on the existing methods of clustering and classification, chosen as the main
ones when building the model, is carried out. As a result of the analysis, two main
models of deep machine learning were identified for solving problems of sequential
clustering and classification - k-means clustering models, and CNN classification
models.  
The fifth section "Development of algorithms for solving the problem of
identifying objects of heterogeneous classes" presents the algorithms of the methods
selected as elements of the model for subsequent software implementation.
The sixth section "Software implementation of the model" describes the
programming language in which the model is implemented, and also provides a
description of the program code for the clustering and classification modules.
The seventh section "Computational experiment" describes the course of the
experiment to determine the types of objects in images of 5 types that are not known
in advance. The effectiveness of the developed model is shown, the identification
accuracy on the test set was about 70%.  
In the Conclusion, a brief description of the studies carried out is given, and the
results obtained are described.  
Appendixes 1 and 2 provide a listing of the developed program code and a
certificate of publication of an article on the developed topic in the RSCI publication.
